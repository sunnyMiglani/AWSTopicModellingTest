# AWSTopicModelingTest
Topic Modelling example using the AWS Comprehend Suite. 

**Goal**: Using the AWS Comprehend Topic Modelling to create a relation between various articles / revision guides on the BBC Bitesize website
that could allow for a relational database that can be queried through alexa! The goal of this repository focuses on uploading files
to the S3 cloud and retrieving the information for when it's done the work.
